# Q1
The major difference between while loops and for loops is that while loops are used to the same code over and over again, like a normal loop, but stops when it meets a specific condition given. For loops are used when integrations of numbers are known already. A while loop could be used to for mathematical purposes such as trying o find how many times a certain number is divisible until it reaches zero. Ex. finding how many times 100 is divisible until it reaches the specific condition of zero. Another example for using a while loops could be finding the area of an object.
# Q2
If/elseif/else statements are strictly used when selecting between two options or alternatives. If there are more than two options present than a switch/case statement would be more appropriately used.
# Q3
There is no need for else to have a conditional statement because the purpose of an else statement is to execute code in the situation that an if/elseif condition returns false.
